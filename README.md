# VerloxsAutoexec
This my CS2 Autoexec Config. This Autoexec includes every single setting in CS2 allowing you to always be able to play with the same settings on any account.

How to use this? Download the zip, Extract the zip, place Autoexec and the Verloxs folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg. Paste +exec autoexec.cfg in your CS2 launch options (go to CS2 in library, click manage, it is the gear icon)

The zip includes all cs2 settings + more which are set to my preference, open up any of the audio, bind, crosshair, hud, mouse, network, script, or video files and change whatever you want to your preference. Scripts includes an AFK move (spinning slowly or running straight, by default is bound to f1), and a bomb drop hotkey to quickly switch to the bomb, drop it, and switch back to your previous weapon (by default h). If you wish to change binds do not change the scancode or hotkey on the same line only change the command. I recommend changing the description too to keep track of what does what easier but it is not required.
